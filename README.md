# Data Science Portfolio Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Portfolio repository! This repository showcases various data science projects and analyses that I have worked on, demonstrating my skills and expertise in the field of data science.



## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of data science projects that cover a wide range of topics, including machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, big data & cloud and more. Each project is contained in its own directory with a dedicated README file that provides an overview of the project, the data sources used, methodologies applied, and the results obtained.

Data science is an ever-evolving field, and this portfolio aims to demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world problems, apply data-driven insights, and communicate findings effectively.

## Projects

- ### End to End project with Deployment
    - [Car Price Prediction Web Application](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/ML_carprediction): 

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Zillow house price prediction](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/Capstone-zillow-prediction): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Disaster Response Classifier using NLP](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/Disaster-Response-Pipeline-Construct-using-NLP): A multilabel classification model to predict the categories of a disaster message. Includes an ETL pipeline for data processing, a ML pipeline to train the model, and a web app, with visualizations, where the model can be used to classify messages. 
    
    _Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Flask, Plotly_


- ### Data Engineering
    - [NYC Taxi Bigquery](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/NYC-Taxi-Bigquery):
    - [Twitter Big Data Pipeline](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/Twitter-Big-Data-Pipeline):

    _Tools: xxx_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

    - [Forecasting USD/EUR Exchange Rate using Arima, GARCH, VAR and RNN models](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/Forecasting-USD-EUR-Exchange-Rate): Time Series Analysis of excahnge rate 
		
	_Tools: R, Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib)_

	
	

- ### [Micro Projects](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/ML_micro_projects): 

	
    - ML with Logistic Regression: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
    - ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
    - ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
    - ML with Support Vector Machines: Using SVM to classify flowers from the famous Iris data set into different categories.


These are just a few examples, and more projects will be added as I continue to work on new data science initiatives.
