# Data Science Portfolio Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Portfolio repository! This repository showcases various data science projects and analyses that I have worked on, demonstrating my skills and expertise in the field of data science.



## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of data science projects that cover a wide range of topics, including machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, big data & cloud and more. Each project is contained in its own directory with a dedicated README file that provides an overview of the project, the data sources used, methodologies applied, and the results obtained.

Data science is an ever-evolving field, and this portfolio aims to demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world problems, apply data-driven insights, and communicate findings effectively.

## Projects

- ### [Micro Projects](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/ML_micro_projects): 

	
    - ML with Logistic Regression: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
    - ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
    - ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
    - ML with Support Vector Machines: Using SVM to classify flowers from the famous Iris data set into different categories.


These are just a few examples, and more projects will be added as I continue to work on new data science initiatives.
