# Data Science Portfolio Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Portfolio repository! This repository showcases various data science projects and analyses that I have worked on, demonstrating my skills and expertise in the field of data science.



## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of data science projects that cover a wide range of topics, including machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, big data & cloud and more. Each project is contained in its own directory with a dedicated README file that provides an overview of the project, the data sources used, methodologies applied, and the results obtained.

Data science is an ever-evolving field, and this portfolio aims to demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world problems, apply data-driven insights, and communicate findings effectively.

## Projects


- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Disaster Message Classifier](https://github.com/sajal2692/disaster-message-classifier): A multilabel classification model to predict the categories of a disaster message. Includes an ETL pipeline for data processing, a ML pipeline to train the model, and a web app, with visualizations, where the model can be used to classify messages. _Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Flask, Plotly_



	_Tools: NLTK, scikit_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

    - [Forecasting USD/EUR Exchange Rate using Arima, GARCH, VAR and RNN models](https://github.com/zhaoshijie1248/Forecasting-USD-EUR-Exchange-Rate): Time Series Analysis of excahnge rate 
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

	
	

- ### Micro Projects: 

	
    - [ML with Logistic Regression](): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
    - [ML with K Nearest Neighbours](): Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
    - [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
    - [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities. 


These are just a few examples, and more projects will be added as I continue to work on new data science initiatives.
